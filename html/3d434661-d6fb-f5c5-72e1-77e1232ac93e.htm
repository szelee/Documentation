            This FEWS is to address the following scenario:
            1) The customer specifies a journey and makes 1 or more reservations.FEWS 6.1 purchase ticket has been successfully executed at this stage so a valid Sales Transaction exists on the CBE with status “AwaitingAuhorisation”.
            2) Before paying (i.e.before FEWS 6.2 purchase confirmation) the customer adds another journey(s) to the basket.When the extra journeys have been added the FEA then issues an amended FEWS 6.1 purchase ticket which includes the revised set of journeys.
            3) The CBE does not have any basket management logic so in this case we want to cancel the original purchase ticket transaction and this is what this FEWS does.
            4) The real problem comes with reservations. The customer may have made reservations prior to the first FEWS 6.1 purchase ticket. In this scenario, these reservations need to be kept rather than asking the customer to re-make reservations for a journey that in most cases will not be changed.
            The processing for this FEWS will disassociate these reservations from the original transaction so they can be re-attached to a new transaction.
            Any reservations not re-attached will be automatically cancelled by the CBE process that cancels un-attached reservations.

                This case arises when the customer has already purchased a ticket without a reservation and
                then requests one by means of FEWS 8.1. The ticket office application will make no attempt to
                identify the CBE transaction – indeed the reservation may be for a non-CBE ticket.There is no
                validation that the reservation made (via FEWS 8.1) is valid for the journey of the customer’s
                travel ticket
                The customer is required to produce their ticket as evidence of a purchase to avoid reservations
                being made without a valid travel ticket.
                It is up to the ticket office staff to ensure that a correct reservation is made.
            </p><p><b>Web, Mobile and Call-Centre</b></p><p>
                This is for adding reservations to existing CBE journey transactions only, or where a bike reservation
                is being associated with a journey transaction for which a seat reservation booking reference has already been associated with the transaction.
                It also allows reservations to be purchased for journeys which have not been booked through CBE.
            </p><p>
                For adding seat reservations to existing journey transactions the transaction needs to be identified by Transaction and Journey Number.
                This is to allow the CBE journey transaction to be updated correctly.
                It also allows a certain amount of validation to be performed that the reservations made are valid for the journey.
                The journey that the reservation is required for must be valid with the associated ticket purchased.
            </p><p>
                For adding bike reservations to a journey transaction which already has a seat reservation associated with it,
                the transaction number and item number of the journey transaction basket item should be provided.
                These will be used to associate the bike reservation transaction with the journey transaction via a ‘transaction pairing’.
            </p><p>
                For obtaining seat reservations to support journeys not booked through CBE, TransactionNumber and ItemNumber should not be populated.
            </p><p>
                The reservation is for either a seat (with seating preferences included), or for a bike.
                In both cases, for the Ticket Office the customer is required to produce their ticket as evidence of
