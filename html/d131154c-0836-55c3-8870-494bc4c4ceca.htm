            If it is a card refund, then it is handled by the front end application using a 3rd party payment provider.The Front End Application, via this FEWS provides the acknowledgement of the refund payment authorisation detail to the CBE.Or where there is a failure to complete the refund, it provides the failure details.For other MOPs the data required depends on the MOP to be used as shown below.
            On receipt of this FEWS and successful processing this triggers the refund state to be completed or failed depending on the response from the PSP. On payment successful the SDCI is then created for refund and an email is issued to the customer informing them of the refund.A failure sets the refund status to “RefundFailed” and will be dealt with manually and this call may be repeated until the refund payment is successful.

                This case arises when the customer has already purchased a ticket without a reservation and
                then requests one by means of FEWS 8.1. The ticket office application will make no attempt to
                identify the CBE transaction – indeed the reservation may be for a non-CBE ticket.There is no
                validation that the reservation made (via FEWS 8.1) is valid for the journey of the customer’s
                travel ticket
                The customer is required to produce their ticket as evidence of a purchase to avoid reservations
                being made without a valid travel ticket.
                It is up to the ticket office staff to ensure that a correct reservation is made.
            </p><p><b>Web, Mobile and Call-Centre</b></p><p>
                This is for adding reservations to existing CBE journey transactions only, or where a bike reservation
                is being associated with a journey transaction for which a seat reservation booking reference has already been associated with the transaction.
                It also allows reservations to be purchased for journeys which have not been booked through CBE.
            </p><p>
                For adding seat reservations to existing journey transactions the transaction needs to be identified by Transaction and Journey Number.
                This is to allow the CBE journey transaction to be updated correctly.
                It also allows a certain amount of validation to be performed that the reservations made are valid for the journey.
                The journey that the reservation is required for must be valid with the associated ticket purchased.
            </p><p>
                For adding bike reservations to a journey transaction which already has a seat reservation associated with it,
                the transaction number and item number of the journey transaction basket item should be provided.
                These will be used to associate the bike reservation transaction with the journey transaction via a ‘transaction pairing’.
